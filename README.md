Learning Objective Evaluator (light)
=============
_This project is a **fork** of the original LO Validation (LOValidate) project._

The Learning Objective Evaluator (light) is a client-side based web-app designed to do basic syntax checking of
learning objectives. Additionally, the goal is to do very light "shallow" parsing for a few semantical relationships.
