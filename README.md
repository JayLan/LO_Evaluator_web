Learning Objective Evaluator (light)
=============
_This project is a **fork** of the original learning objective validation [(LOValidate)](https://github.com/JayLan/LOValidate.git) project._

The Learning Objective Evaluator (light) is a client-side based web-app designed to do basic syntax checking of
learning objectives. Additionally, the goal is to do very light "shallow" parsing for a few semantical relationships.

Key Notes:
* Uses HTML 5 File API
